# Pluto

Pluto is a free app where you can share food and accesories with other pet owners! You can easily put on stuff you don't need anymore or find used accesories for your pets and reduce waste! 

There's also support option, where you can help nearbiest animal shelters, organisations or private persons who are in need!

Our goal is to connect pet owners and encourage them to helping each others when in need.


Lot's of animal shelters need staff to take care of all animals, so we came up with Voluntary services. User could register as volounter from animal shelter profile and become verified helper.

Verified helpers would have acces to special tab where they could find recent calls for help and contact with shelter.

## Technology

For now we only have a Front-end app which is written using Angular framework. We plan on implement Server Side Rendering at least for our main page, so that it loads quickly for everyone. As for backend, we would probably go with Java.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
